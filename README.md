# Plex and NFS Integration

This guide will walk you through the technical process of integrating Plex with NFS. 📺

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the following:

- A Plex Media Server installed and running 🖥️
- A network-attached storage (NAS) device with NFS support 📦
- Basic knowledge of Linux and command line 💻

## Step 1: Set up NFS on your NAS

First, you'll need to set up NFS on your NAS. This typically involves installing the NFS server software, configuring the NFS exports file to define the directories you want to share, and starting the NFS server. The exact steps will vary depending on your NAS device, so consult your device's documentation for specific instructions. 📋

## Step 2: Mount your NFS share on your Plex server

Once NFS is set up on your NAS, you'll need to mount your NFS share on your Plex server. This is typically done by running the `mount` command with the appropriate options. The exact command will depend on your server's operating system and the NFS server's configuration. Consult your server's documentation for specific instructions. 📂

## Step 3: Configure Plex to use your NFS share

Finally, you'll need to configure Plex to use your NFS share. This is typically done through the Plex web interface, by adding a new library and specifying the path to your NFS share. The exact steps will depend on your Plex server's version. Consult the Plex documentation for specific instructions. 📡

That's it! Your Plex server should now be able to access your media files on your NFS share. 🎉
